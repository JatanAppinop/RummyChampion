   ❌ Player elimination notifications
   Game Logic:
   ❌ Drop confirmation system

   Recommended Implementation Priority:
   High Priority (Core Gameplay):
   Drop System - Essential for Pool Rummy
   Elimination Logic - Required for Pool variants
   Game Mode-Specific Win Conditions
   Medium Priority (User Experience):
   Drop Confirmation UI
   Game Mode Indicators
   Elimination Notifications
   Low Priority (Polish):
   Enhanced Scoring Displays
   Game Mode Tutorials
   Advanced Statistics
   The codebase has a solid foundation but needs significant additions to fully implement the three main Rummy variants. The most critical missing piece is the drop system for Pool Rummy, which is currently only defined in constants but not implemented in the game logic
