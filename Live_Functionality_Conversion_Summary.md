## 🔧 **MAJOR CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. ✅ Player Ready Event Fixed**
**Issue:** Client sends `player_ready` event but backend doesn't respond with next event.
**Solution:** Added missing player_ready response handler in SocketServer.cs

#### **Added to SocketServer.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 MISSING: Player Ready Response Handler
socket.OnUnityThread(Enum.GetName(typeof(RummySocketEvents), RummySocketEvents.player_ready), response =>
{
    try
    {
        Debug.Log($"[Socket] Received: player_ready response");
        var responseParsed = response.GetValue<Dictionary<string, object>>();
        
        if (responseParsed.ContainsKey("nextEvent"))
        {
            string nextEvent = responseParsed["nextEvent"].ToString();
            HandlePlayerReadyResponse(nextEvent, responseParsed);
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        Debug.LogError($"Failed to handle player_ready response: {e.Message}");
    }
});

private void HandlePlayerReadyResponse(string nextEvent, Dictionary<string, object> responseData)
{
    // Handles: start_game, start_turn, next_turn, deal_cards, wait_for_players
}
```

### **2. ✅ Test Manager Disabled for Production**
**RummyTestManager.cs Changes:**
- ✅ `enableTestMode = false` by default
- ✅ Added production warnings
- ✅ Auto-disables in production builds
- ✅ All test functionality moved to live systems

### **3. ✅ Live Pool Rummy Implementation**
**Previously:** Only test functionality existed
**Now:** Complete live Pool Rummy system

#### **Added to GameManager.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 NEW: Live Pool Rummy Initialization
private void InitializePoolRummyLive()
{
    // Reset pool game state
    poolGameEnded = false;
    eliminatedPlayers.Clear();
    
    // Set elimination threshold (101 or 201)
    int threshold = GetEliminationThreshold();
    
    // Initialize all players for Pool Rummy
    foreach (Player player in playerList)
    {
        player.ResetForNewGame();
        player.playerUI?.UpdateGameModeSpecificUI(GameMode.Pool);
        
        // Subscribe to elimination and drop events
        player.OnPlayerDropped += OnPlayerDropped;
        player.OnPlayerEliminated += OnPlayerEliminated;
    }
}
```

#### **Enhanced RoundEndScreen.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 LIVE FUNCTIONALITY: Pool Rummy progression
private void HandlePoolRummyEnd(int winnerDeadwoodScore, int loserDeadwoodScore)
{
    // Update cumulative scores (winner gets 0, loser gets difference)
    loser.player.AddToCumulativeScore(scoreDifference);
    
    // Check for elimination
    CheckForPlayerElimination();
    
    // Check if game should end or continue
    if (gameManager.GetActivePlayersCount() <= 1)
        HandlePoolGameCompletion();
    else
        HandlePoolGameContinuation();
}
```

### **4. ✅ Live Deals Rummy Implementation** 
**Previously:** Only test functionality existed
**Now:** Complete live Deals Rummy system

#### **Added to GameManager.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 NEW: Live Deals Rummy Initialization
private void InitializeDealsRummyLive()
{
    // Get number of deals from table data
    int numberOfDeals = GetDealsFromGameType(tableData.gameType);
    
    // Initialize deals management
    InitializeDealsRummy(numberOfDeals);
    
    // Initialize all players for Deals Rummy
    foreach (Player player in playerList)
    {
        player.ResetForNewGame();
        player.playerUI?.UpdateGameModeSpecificUI(GameMode.Deals);
    }
}
```

#### **Enhanced RoundEndScreen.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 LIVE FUNCTIONALITY: Deals Rummy progression
private void HandleDealsRummyEnd(int winnerDeadwoodScore, int loserDeadwoodScore)
{
    // Update cumulative scores and deals won
    loser.player.AddToCumulativeScore(scoreDifference);
    winner.player.IncrementDealsWon();
    
    // Check if final deal or continue
    if (gameManager.GetCurrentDealNumber() >= gameManager.GetTotalDeals())
        HandleFinalDealsRummyCompletion();
    else
        HandleDealsRummyContinuation();
}
```

### **5. ✅ Enhanced Game Initialization**
**Modified GameManager.StartGame():**
```csharp
public async void StartGame()
{
    Debug.Log($"Starting Game with mode: {gameMode}");
    
    // 🔹 INITIALIZE GAME MODE SPECIFIC LOGIC (MOVED FROM TEST TO LIVE)
    InitializeGameModeLogic();
    
    // ... existing game start logic ...
    
    // Send player_ready event with proper async handling
    var task = RummySocketServer.Instance.SendEvent(RummySocketEvents.player_ready)
        .ContinueWith(t => Debug.Log("player_ready event sent successfully"));
}
```

### **6. ✅ Enhanced Player State Management**
**Added to Player.cs:**
```csharp
// 🔹 NEW: Reset for new game (Pool/Deals Rummy)
public void ResetForNewGame()
{
    hasDropped = false;
    isEliminated = false;
    hasPickedCardThisTurn = false;
    cumulativeScore = 0;
    dealsWon = 0;
    
    playerUI?.ResetEnhancedUI();
}
```
